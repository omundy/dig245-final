# DIG 245 Final Project

Design and program a web application as a creative response to content from the course.


## Introduction

We‚Äôve examined several issues around design and the internet this semester. Some forms are easy to identify, like how dark patterns manipulate user experiences by affecting usability and user expectations. Others, like the relationship between the surveillance economy and social justice are harder to visualize, but equally important when we consider whether the internet is or is not a positive force in society.

At the beginning of the semester, the [View Source](https://github.com/omundy/dig245-view-source) assignment asked you to think about why it is important to be able to know how a web page works ‚Äúunder the hood.‚Äù This final assignment challenges you to further investigate one or more of your preferred themes (from or related to the course) and conceive of and build a creative response in the form of a web application that likewise makes the topic more understandable, relevant, or transparent.

Your application will consist of HTML, CSS, Javascript, and any additional libraries you may need, but it should address the topic through an interactive experience that involves a user somehow inputting data, and your app transforming that data to reveal insights into your chosen topic.

<small>The following steps are represented in this diagram.</small>






## 1 - Concept

*Identify a topic, collect research, prepare a summary for a brainstorming session.*

1. **Identify potential topics** to explore. It shouldn't be too specific, nor too broad. Is there a specific problem you want to solve? Or do you wish to address issues by [problematizing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problematization) your subject?
1. **Collect research** (related articles, etc.) **and examples** (2-3 links or summaries of similar projects). See the [Critical Web Design Index](https://criticalwebdesign.github.io/index) for inspiration.
1. **Identify new skills or technologies** (e.g. a design method, programming pattern, code library, etc.) you are interested to learn and could potentially use in your project.
1. **Write a summary** of your topic(s), research, and technology (3‚Äì4 sentences). Address why you are drawn to this topic and why it is important to explore. Identify the communities, resources, and issues involved. What [frameworks](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1OWc_e1pquvwKi4qxJShsZ1Rqia1dbDBcwpxYwdOic7o/edit#slide=id.g165f853ab3b_0_0) or methodologies might you use?
1. Bring the above to class for the...

<details>
<summary>In-class activity</summary>

In groups, brainstorm on your topic(s) use the <a href="https://omundy.github.io/project-development-template/materials/brainstorming-disney-method/index.html" target="_blank">Disney Creative Strategy</a>, which asks your group to assume different "hats" in order to ideate on concepts, solutions, and risks.

1. Everyone: post your subject or concept in Slack
1. As Dreamers, add new ideas for projects based on the subject to the posts in your group
    - How might you create something that helps others discuss, think about, or help to solve the issue?
    - The more ideas the better. Brainstorming aims to produce quantity, from which we select quality ideas.
    - No criticism. Our goal is to generate a pool of ideas. All ideas are welcome.
1. As Realists, after all have posted, talk about each in a group
    - Think more practically, about how you would put the ideas into practice.
1. After the session, explore the ideas and notes as a critic, to figure out what you can build in the given time

## 2 - Proposal

Create a pitch deck (10-15 slide **Google Presentation**)* to share and plan your project that contains:

1. A one paragraph introduction to your concept and what you plan to make. Who will use this and why?
1. An initial attempt at an [identity](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1exnY8fjVsOc3bKZFESJIM2s4JKxhqg_oASPDPokSfrE/edit?usp=sharing) (e.g. a logo, word mark, style guide, etc.).
1. Competition Scan - Examples (2‚Äì3) of similar works (in concept or tech) with images and links.
1. Flowcharts (2‚Äì3) showing each step users see, and another [showing how data works](https://www.google.com/search?q=a+flowchart+that+tracks+data+through+the+app&safe=off&tbm=isch) in the app
1. [Wireframes](https://www.dreamhost.com/blog/how-to-wireframe-website/) showing all the views in the interface (introduction page, forms, results page)
1. Technology - Include [pseudocode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudocode) of the main logic of your project. List technologies and demos you think you will need. List the "**unknowns**"‚Äîparts of your idea that you don't know yet how to execute.





<details>
<summary>In-class activity (lightening talks)</summary>

##### <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_talk">Lightning talks</a> of your pitches
1. Share a link to your proposal in Slack.
1. Present slides on Zoom. 3 minutes max.
1. 1 minute max for questions / comments. Add others in Slack thread.

</details>

<details>
<summary>In-class activity (speed dating)</summary>

1. Your partner should ask questions and make comments while you make notes. (1 min)
1. Switch roles and repeat the above.
1. Switch partners and repeat.

</details>






## 3 - Prototype

Create a working ‚Äúproof of concept‚Äù of your app.

1. Fork this repository and clone it to your machine.
1. Your prototype should contain the essential functions of your project.
1. Your work should be live (able to be shared via a link in Slack)
1. Feel free to fork and use any example repository from class to get started.
1. [Save and refresh](https://github.com/omundy/learn-computing/blob/main/topics-keyboard-shortcuts.md#web-development-edit-save-refresh-loop) your work in the browser often to see your changes. Commit changes regularly.

<details>
<summary>In-class activity</summary>

In groups, share your prototypes to get feedback:

- Be ready to explain the current status of your work.
- Bring specific questions or unknowns (concept, design, tech) you would like to discuss with your group.

</details>





## 4 - Design

Design iterations of main views.

1. The design should reflect the overall concept and goals of your project.
1. Create your design iterations with [Figma](https://figma.com), or use the Bootstrap template included in this repo `designs/1.psd`. **Show your work!** Do not delete previous versions‚Äîwe want to see your progress as you iterate and improve your designs.
1. Include a [Moodboard](https://www.google.com/search?q=web+design+moodboard) showing your research into how others have designed solutions to similar information and design problems
1. Create multiple iterations of each different page / view your app.
1. As per class [presentations](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BiIHVEQjmIb2k2vB6N3x1g_S3KSLyZq2YCniq1ONjg8/edit?usp=sharing), look at relevant examples of good design to help you improve your own, then experiment and iterate!
1. **Do not use AI-generated logos, icons, images, etc.** An important part of a design practice includes creating the ideas for these things and producing them yourself. At the very least, consider using royalty free images created by actual humans from https://thenounproject.com/ or  https://unsplash.com/ instead of using whatever AI barfs up.


<details>
<summary>In-class activity</summary>

Share your iterations to get feedback before coding the final design.

- Bring to class: What are three questions you would like to ask each user of your potential design?
- In-class: [Design Critique: Imaginary Audience](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BiIHVEQjmIb2k2vB6N3x1g_S3KSLyZq2YCniq1ONjg8/edit#slide=id.gf16dac508b_0_0)

</details>





## 5 - Design + Prototype


1. Combine your coded design and prototype
1. Your project should be 95% complete

<!--
Examples:

[Probability football](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QO5ZFlc8GQilGughUaI57RlhQKc8TWECiqR7wkwjTwQ/edit#slide=id.p)

-->

<details>
<summary>In-class activity</summary>

1. Make sure your project is live and ready to share. Post a link to it and Figma in Slack.
1. Share your project in a small group (watch other use it, get specific feedback)
1. Then, we'll go around the room and those who wish can share with the whole class in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_talk">lightning talks</a> (3 min.) format.

</details>






## 6 - Deliverables

Your finished project should include:

#### The Project

1. Your coded design (valid [HTML](https://validator.w3.org/) and [CSS](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) <sup>([?](https://github.com/omundy/dig245-critical-web-design/blob/main/topics/html-css/css.md#css-validation))</sup>) combined with your prototype in a final application.
1. About page: A well-designed, but simple page that contextualizes your project. It could appear as an introduction to the project or provided at the end to explain what happened.
1. The project should be live, hosted on Github Pages, Davidson Domains, or [some other server](https://github.com/omundy/learn-javascript/blob/main/topics/servers/servers.md).


#### Documentation

1. A Google Presentation (update your original proposal with screenshots, text, flowcharts, etc.) to document and share your finished project.
1. A screencast video taken on your computer (do not use a cell phone!) (1:30 max) to demonstrate how your project works (see [tips](https://omundy.github.io/learn-computing/slides/documentation.html))
1. A 200‚Äì300 word statement explaining your concept and execution. This can be posted in Moodle, or included somehow in the actual project (e.g. the Intro page).
